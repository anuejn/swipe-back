# Firefox Extension: Swipe-Back

This is a fork of the "Two-Finger History Jump" extension.
Props to the authors of that extension.

From the "Two-Finger History Jump" README:
> This add-on allows you to jump back/forward in the browser's history by swiping
> horizontally with two fingers on your touchpad. Swiping to the left will take you
> back one page, while swiping to the right will do the opposite. It mimics the
> default behaviour on Mac Os. It needs the 'Access your data for all websites'
> permission in order to access the browser's local storage and be able to save
> its settings persistently.


## Differences to "Two-Finger History Jump"
* A different UI concept (really move the website contents as swipe indication)
* Replaces configuration options with (hopefully) sane defaults.
* Fixes horizontal scrolling.
